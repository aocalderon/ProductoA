	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..2018932S},
	abstract = {Estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are debated because of the large difference between published values from in situ and remote sensing observations (Avitabile et al., GCB, 2016). Spaceborne remote sensing provides a synoptic view of forest biophysical properties globally; however, none is directly related to forest biomass. Still, by optimally exploiting the information content of the observations available in remote sensing archives, it is believed that the knowledge of the spatial distribution of forest biomass can be improved given that published estimates have mostly been based on a handful of the observations available. In this respect, an innovative approach to estimate biomass globally was developed by combining spaceborne SAR, LiDAR and optical observations for around the year 2010 together with auxiliary datasets from forest inventories, additional remote sensing observations, climatological variables and ecosystems classifications. Modelling frameworks relating remote sensing data to biomass that were identified to adapt to different forest and environmental conditions and not requiring in situ data for training were selected. As none of them was yet capable of providing a true global mapping without systematic errors, a rule-based combination of EO-based estimates of biomass from the different algorithms was developed. Accordingly, estimates of standard error were generated. To disentangle scattering physics related to forest structural properties from other variables influencing the biomass (namely wood density and proportion of branches and needles), the retrieval estimated forest growing stock volume (GSV) in m3/ha. Key to the estimation of AGB was then the generation, first of its kind, of global estimates of wood density and stem-to-total biomass expansion factors from a large data pool of in situ measurements globally. Estimates were generated at the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data (25 m) and assessed at several spatial scales from forest plot size to regional averages. The retrieval error for aggregated estimates at 1 ha scale was around 20-40\% and estimates were found to be mostly unbiased. The validation exercise indicated that spatial patterns of biomass were well captured and reliability of the biomass estimates even in the wet tropics. This was initially considered to be beyond the capability of the EO datasets and algorithms available to this study. The estimates, however, present local biases and substantial uncertainties, primarily in regions where the remote sensing data available could only partially resolve forest structures (pockets of very high biomass) or the conversion from volume to biomass was poorly characterized. The largest biomass pools were estimated in wet tropical forests and in temperate forests of the southern hemisphere. Lower AGB was estimated in boreal forest and for forests of the dry topics. With respect to existing biomass estimates (e.g., Saatchi et al., PNAS, 2011; Baccini et al., Nat. Clim. Change, 2012; Thurner et al., GEB, 2014; FAO, 2010), we identified overestimation of biomass in the tropics of the northern hemisphere by a factor 2. Understanding the overall quality of our estimates and assessing the impact of our global biomass estimates is foreseen for the meeting.},

	abstract = {Cloud cover can influence numerous important ecological processes, including reproduction, growth, survival, and behavior, yet our assessment of its importance at the appropriate spatial scales has remained remarkably limited. If captured over a large extent yet at sufficiently fine spatial grain, cloud cover dynamics may provide key information for delineating a variety of habitat types and predicting species distributions. Here, we develop new near-global, fine-grain (≈1 km) monthly cloud frequencies from 15 y of twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images that expose spatiotemporal cloud cover dynamics of previously undocumented global complexity. We demonstrate that cloud cover varies strongly in its geographic heterogeneity and that the direct, observation-based nature of cloud-derived metrics can improve predictions of habitats, ecosystem, and species distributions with reduced spatial autocorrelation compared to commonly used interpolated climate data. These findings support the fundamental role of remote sensing as an effective lens through which to understand and globally monitor the fine-grain spatial variability of key biodiversity and ecosystem properties.},

strategies which reduce pollution. Examples such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions promote an increase in the carbon footprint. This carries 
the search for resources from renewable sources as sunlight, wind, rain, waves, etc. From these sources, solar energy could be used in Colombia, especially the 
Atlantic Coast, due to high solar radiation in this region. This study is going to collect information about the advantages and disadvantages of using 
photovoltaic systems (PV systems) for solar energy management with a good cost-efficiency ratio. On the other hand, the development of solar energy will be 
studied and compared with other energy sources. In Colombia, there is a set of energy and regulatory policies around small self-generators with renewable energy 
sources, which can be natural or legal persons, that is, self-generators could be civilians, merchants, or small industries. Finally, it will be discussed about 
the energy plans as a proposal for improved energy management in the future.Keywords: Energy Efficiency, Renewable Sources, Energy Management, Photovoltaic

method is based on fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) derived from GIS analysis. It makes use of nine causal landslide factors identified by local landslide 
experts. Fuzzy set theory was first integrated with an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in order to use pairwise comparisons to compare LSM criteria for 
ranking purposes. FMFs were then applied in order to determine the criteria weights to be used in the development of a landslide susceptibility map. Finally, a 
landslide inventory database was used to validate the LSM map by comparing it with known landslides within the study area. Results indicated that the 
integration of fuzzy set theory with AHP produced significantly improved accuracies and a high level of reliability in the resulting landslide susceptibility 
map. Approximately 53\% of known landslides within our study area fell within zones classified as having “very high susceptibility”, with the further 31\% 
falling into zones classified as having “high susceptibility”.,

	abstract = {Increasing population and life standards causes fossil fuel consumption to increase. Due to this increasing consumption, fossil fuels are being 
depleted rapidly. In addition to rapid exhaustion, another important problem associated with fossil fuels is that their consumption has major negative impacts 
on the environment. Therefore, many countries around the world have included renewable energy systems (RES) in their future energy plans so that they can 
produce reliable and environmentally friendly energy. Parallel to this trend, various RES have been identified and recently integrated into the current energy 
network of Turkey as well. However, it should be recognized that renewable energy resources are not fully environmentally safe. Different RES are associated 
with different environmental impacts. In planning the future energy development of a country, evaluation of renewable energy resources potentials together with 
their associated environmental impacts is critical. The aim of this study is to create a decision support system for site selection of wind turbines using 
Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Wind energy potential and environmental fitness/acceptability are used as decision criteria for the site selection 
process. Potential environmental impacts of wind generation are identified in accordance with Turkish legislations and previous studies; and represented as 
fuzzy objectives of the decision problem. Wind potential map of Turkey generated by General Directorate of Electrical Power Resources Survey and Development is 
used to identify economically feasible locations in terms of wind energy generation. A study area composed of Usak, Aydin, Denizli, Mugla, and Burdur provinces 
in Turkey is selected and divided into 250m×250m grids. Each grid represents an alternative location for a wind turbine or group of wind turbines. Fuzzy 
environmental objectives such as “Acceptable in terms of noise level”, “Acceptable in terms of bird habitat”, “Acceptable in terms of safety and aesthetics” and 
“Safe in terms of natural reserves” associated with wind turbines are identified based on previous research and each of these objectives are represented by a 
fuzzy set. Individual satisfaction degree of each of these environmental objectives for each grid is calculated. Then these individual satisfactions are 
aggregated into an overall satisfaction degree using various aggregator operators such as “and”, “or”, and “order weighted averaging.” Thus, an overall 
satisfaction degree of all the environmental objectives is obtained for each grid in the study area. A map of environmental fitness is developed in GIS 
environment by using these overall satisfaction degrees. Then this map is utilized together with the wind potential map of Turkey to identify both potentially 
and environmentally feasible wind turbine locations within the study area.},

	abstract = {The integration of GIS and multicriteria decision analysis has attracted significant interest over the last 15 years or so. This paper surveys 
the GIS‐based multicriteria decision analysis (GIS‐MCDA) approaches using a literature review and classification of articles from 1990 to 2004. An electronic 
search indicated that over 300 articles appeared in refereed journals. The paper provides taxonomy of those articles and identifies trends and developments in 
GIS‐MCDA.},

	issn = {9173231266},
	abstract = {Due to the negative impact on the environment of traditional powergenerating methods, especially coal and oil-fired power stations wind power 
has increased in popularity. Achieving the goal set by the EU due to the implementation of the Kyoto protocol will require further expansion, and in order to 
facilitate this process around the Baltic Sea. A project – Wind Energy in the Baltic Sea Region - financed by EU / INTERREG III B was initiated in order to 
develop methods and tools to support spatial planning in relation to wind energy. The aim of the current study is to develop multi-criteria evaluations, which 
can provide tools for analysing the complex trade-offs between choice alternatives with different environmental and socio-economic impacts. The weaknesses of 
the Boolean logic have been recognised in recent years and a fuzzy logic approach is applied in the system design. The developed methodology is based on data 
form Northern Jutland, but later on this kind of multi-criteria will be used in the in Finland and Estonia.},
